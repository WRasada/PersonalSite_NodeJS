This site will be utilizing the MEAN stack; however, to start it will not have any Angular. Angular will be used later on as I continue to learn.

Current list of packages:

 - express
 - body-parser
 - hbs
 - method-override
 - mongoose
 - nodemailer
 - express-validator
 - dateformat


will update as I add more.
